*When making contributions:*

- Follow the format: [Approved logo/ Not approved logo]; Entry [title and link]; - Description; Location; Processor; *(Note: details)*

    HTML Example:
```
                &#9989; <a href="https://sporebaby.com/">Spore Baby</a> - Mushroom spores.
                Location: Nevada, USA. Processor: Coin Payments.
                <i>
                    (Note: The sale and possession of cubensis mushroom spores is legal in the United States however they
                    can&apos;t ship to Idaho, California, or Georgia due to their state laws)
                </i>
```
- Alphabetize your edits (make sure the category, sub-category and listing are in correct ABC order).
- Include a description of the product or service next to your entry.
- The website you link to **must** clearly state that it accepts Monero somewhere or have it on the checkout page. If this isn't present there is no way to confirm that the business accepts Monero.
- If necessary, add notes to your entry. For example, if there is a Monero discount, minimum order amount, country restrictions, etc. please include them. Example: (Notes: 15% Monero discount)
- HTML encode all entities, do not use things like emoji symbols without encoding.
- If you are adding a business, services or otherwise which is your own, you cannot approve or not approve of it as this must come from the community.
- When possible:
    - Add a verified checkmark if it's a service you have used (alternatively, if it's not a valid service, use the X symbol).
    - Include the location. Example: Location: New York, USA.
    - Include the payment processor. Example: Processor: Coin Payments.
- Look at existing entries for guidance
