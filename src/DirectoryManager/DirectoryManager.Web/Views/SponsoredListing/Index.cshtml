<h2>Listing Details</h2>
<p>
Sponsored listings are a way to support the directory and get your selected listing seen by more people.
A maximum of three sponsored listings are shown at the top of the directory.
The topmost listing is the one that has the longest duration of time left for its payment.
In addition to being at the top of the page, your listing is also highlighted in the normal list.
